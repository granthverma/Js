1. What is JavaScript?
Answer: JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used for building interactive and dynamic web pages. It is a client-side scripting language, which means it runs in the user's web browser.

2. What is the difference between let, const, and var in JavaScript for variable declaration?
Answer:

var is function-scoped and can be redeclared, allowing variables to be hoisted.
let is block-scoped, can be reassigned but not redeclared, and does not hoist.
const is block-scoped, cannot be reassigned or redeclared, and does not hoist. It is used for constants.
3. Explain hoisting in JavaScript.
Answer: Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.

4. What is the event loop in JavaScript?
Answer: The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that handles asynchronous operations. It continuously checks the message queue for events and executes them in a non-blocking way. This allows JavaScript to be single-threaded while handling multiple operations concurrently.

5. Explain closures in JavaScript.
Answer: Closures are functions that have access to variables from their outer (enclosing) scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. They "close over" the variables, retaining access to them.

6. What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?
Answer:

== is the equality operator and performs type coercion, meaning it converts the operands to the same type before making the comparison.
=== is the strict equality operator and does not perform type coercion. It checks both value and type.
7. Explain the concept of prototypal inheritance in JavaScript.
Answer: In JavaScript, objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects through a mechanism called prototypal inheritance. Each object has a prototype object, and properties/methods not found in the object itself are looked up in its prototype chain.

8. What is the difference between null and undefined?
Answer:

undefined is a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value.
null is an assignment value representing the absence of any object value.
9. How does this keyword work in JavaScript?
Answer: The value of this in JavaScript depends on how a function is called:

In a regular function, this refers to the global object (e.g., window in a browser).
In a method (a function within an object), this refers to the object that the method was called on.
In an event handler, this refers to the element that triggered the event.
10. Explain the concept of Promises in JavaScript.


```
**Answer:** Promises are objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. They have states (pending, fulfilled, or rejected) and can be chained to handle asynchronous operations more effectively than callbacks.

```
